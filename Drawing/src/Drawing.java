    Here are the actual rules for numeric promotion, from section 5.6.2 of the JLS:

    When an operator applies binary numeric promotion to a pair of operands
    (each of which must denote a value that is convertible to a numeric type),
    the following rules apply, in order, using widening conversion (ยง5.1.2) to convert operands as necessary:

    If any of the operands is of a reference type, unboxing conversion (ยง5.1.8) is performed. Then:
    If either operand is of type double, the other is converted to double.
    Otherwise, if either operand is of type float, the other is converted to float.
    Otherwise, if either operand is of type long, the other is converted to long.
    Otherwise, both operands are converted to type int.
